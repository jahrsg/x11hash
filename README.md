# x11hash
Cross-compiler x11 hash lib (gcc and msvc compatible). Sources are getted from http://www.saphir2.com/sphlib/
MIT license. 

Resulting hash values are compatible with x11 cpu miners (https://github.com/ig0tik3d/darkcoin-cpuminer-1.2c). 
Values from this miner are used as test values for this lib (see hashlist.data file, it contains some binary 
data and their hashes logged from this miner)
